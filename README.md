4e-Combat-Tracker
=================

 This program creates random monsters for characters to battle in a campaign, to cut down the amount of time DM's spend managing combat.      
 It assumes that no one rolls Initiative, just to cut down on time.    
 I'm using this project to inspire myself to learn more about Java,Regular Expressions, and programming GUIs.
